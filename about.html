        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Zainab Majidi and I've been learning the different coding languages including HTML, CSS<, Javascript, etc. for about 3 years now. My journey with coding can be viewed through the projects I have created over the last few years which can be found under the 'Projects' tab listed at the top. </p>
   <p> After highschool, I plan on going into the medical field and studying something within that field. As of right now, I want to go into dermatology and eventually create a skincare brand. Coding can greatly assist me with future plans as it can make me independent especially if I plan on opening a skin care business in which I can rely on myself.  </p>
